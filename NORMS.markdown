## ðŸ—“ Availability

### Preferred Working Hours

- Kevin: I'm super productive in the morning. After 13:00 CST I'm useless.

### Opinions on Personal Time

- Kevin: I prefer to have a strict daytime working schedule with nights and weekends to myself. Happy to do overtime, but it would need to be explicitly planned rather than assumed.

### Anticipated Conflicts
_Put conflicts here_

- ðŸš« Kevin has office hours 16:00 CST Thursday 9/24

## Daily process

- Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
- Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by todayâ€™s Taskmaster)
- Pair program on assigned tasks
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for End of Day merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs(Pull Request), review each otherâ€™s code and merge into master


## Team expectations

- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting anotherâ€™s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Donâ€™t interrupt - raise your hand
- Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on
- Issues
- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
- Take 10-15 minute break
- List out the pros / cons
- Vote on it
- If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
- If you are frustrated
- Take a walk or get some water
- Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
- Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
